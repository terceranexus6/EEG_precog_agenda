# HOWTO

First of all, connect your devide to the computer using a long USB wire. Don't forget to turn on the device apart from the arduino itself. Once it's connected open the arduino IDE and upload the .ino code in the "arduino" directory to the arduino. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Before uploading the code, disconnect the RX wire, it would create an uploading error otherwise. As soon as you see the "done uploading" message, you can connect again the wire. Proceed putting on the device.

Open a terminal, we are about to execute python now. **It's not python3**!

```
  python prueba.py
```
Then do what it says.
