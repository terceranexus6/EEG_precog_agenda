# Why experimenting on human-machine interaction?

Human-machine interaction investigation aims to enhance the user experience by creating a more reliable, natural environment for her/him. Mark Weisser, "father" of ubiquous computing, in his paper "[The Computer for the 21st Century](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf)" said:

```
The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguish.
```

Keeping the goal of making technology interaction a natural performance in our everyday lives requires a deep investigation of society, technology and philosophy. For this, our computers, wereables devices and similar daily gadgets are improved constantly, not only in resources but interface.

For this, with this project I was aiming to reach some of the most important points when providing a brand new interface to the users:

- Something that doesn't requires deep learning and provides an intuitive usability.
- Something that implies a sustantial change in our current computer interacion.
- Low cost
- Open source
